<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

## Software Architechture

Software Architecture: In the realm of software development, "software architecture" refers to the high-level structure and organization of a software system. It defines the components, modules, and their relationships within a software application. Software architects make decisions about the system's structure to ensure it meets performance, scalability, and maintainability requirements.

## Usage

If you want to use the project template that I use, I will share it for free. I have tweaked or customized the settings according to your needs. I use Gatsby framework technology. If you are interested in learning, you can directly check the official documentation.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)_
